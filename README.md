# Random-Bikeshare-Tripper
## Intro
This web app was created to generate routes between two bikeshare locations across the City of Toronto. The route generated has a travel time of 30 minutes ensuring that your bikeshare ride is free. Generate a route and explore a different part of the city with your bikeshare membership. :)

This was my first time using the Google Cloud Platform to utilize their Directions API. In addition, I spent a little longer to nail down flexbox and other CSS styling.
